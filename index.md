I am an applied mathematician and computational scientist whose research focuses on modeling the mechanics and fluid dynamics of the heart and its valves. I create new modeling methods and use them to study heart disease.

I am a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford University in the [Cardiovascular Biomechanics Computation Laboratory](https://cbcl.stanford.edu/), led [Alison Marsden](https://profiles.stanford.edu/alison-marsden). I collaborator with  [Michael Ma](https://med.stanford.edu/content/sm/cve.html.html) and [William Hiesinger](https://med.stanford.edu/hiesingerlab.html), from the Dept. of Cardiothoracic Surgery. 

I completed my PhD in Mathematics in 2017 at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University working with [Charles Peskin](https://www.math.nyu.edu/~peskin/). My [thesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13317) concerned the mitral valve. 

One of my favorite techniques is design-based elasticity. We require that the model valve supports a pressure, find an associated differential equation, then derive valve geometry and material properties from its solution. By altering parameters in these differential equations -- specifying just the right math problem -- we design the emergent model to match experimental data where the data is good, but produce features like material heterogeneity and a full map of fiber orientations that are very difficult to measure experimentally. These techniques illuminate facts and generate hypotheses about valve anatomy and mechanics, and they make highly effective models to use in fluid-structure interaction simulations for studies of flow and disease.
