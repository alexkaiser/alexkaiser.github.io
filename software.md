See my [Github profile](https://github.com/alexkaiser). 

Open source projects on which I am the primary author:

* [heart_valves](http://github.com/alexkaiser/heart_valves): Model generation and FSI for aortic and mitral valves. Includes code that calls IBAMR for fluid structure interaction, scripts, plotting, movie generation.

* [mc_stretch](http://github.com/alexkaiser/mc_stretch): Fast, affine-invariant, GPU parallel MCMC

* [SimplifySum](http://github.com/alexkaiser/SimplifySum): Automatic simplification of symbolic sums in Mathematica



Open source projects on which I have contributed:

* [SimVascular](http://simvascular.github.io/): Comprehensive tools for modeling and simulation of patient-specific vascular flows

* [IBAMR](http://ibamr.github.io/): Immersed boundary adaptive mesh refinement, fluid-structure code interaction suitable for simulating heart valve mechanics

* [ARPREC](https://www.davidhbailey.com/dhbsoftware/): Arbitrary precision arithmetic in C++ with overloaded operators. Previously run by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, now mirrored by David H. Bailey.

* [QD](https://www.davidhbailey.com/dhbsoftware/): Double-double and quad double precision arithmetic in C++ with overloaded operators. Previously run by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, now mirrored by David H. Bailey.

* MatrixFFT: Appleâ€™s FFT library. Both library development and the advanced computation group who developed it appear to be discontinued since I worked with them in 2010.
